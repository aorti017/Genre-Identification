OJ, this for Central Cali right here
Yah... yah, yah, yah
Keep the pork from out my rice
Immigration ain't an issue for the right
Cause it ain't right to have right to keep the laws in favor of the job creator
When the job creator ship a factory for cheaper labor
Labor low enough to keep the people quiet and complacent
When the money is getting spent right on a soil that's adjacent
To the place that they are staving, so hop a fence
Coffee in my blood will keep the dogs out off my sense
Skin color verse the board of education
If you ain't catch that line then you should study segregation
This is rap mediation
Time to snap you right back in to place
Cause they be begging for some shit from back from before 2008
I'm thinking 1998, 90 crates with 2 turn tables
Around the time when your auntie Merly
Put a tattoo on her ankle
Talking ratchet, when ratchet was escaping all the drama
Back when we could work for honor, working a blue collar
I am from a different time, uphold a different code
I hope we are connected, but I don't know
Cause I know couple people listening is dealing with some real shit (Ooh that's right) real shit
Feel like packing up your shit and skip a town for a bit
I'll throw you on my carry on and we take take a trip
Where we can snorkel with the fish and hear some real rap shit
Make love in the sand over some real rap shit
I'm a career MC, working on minimum wage
Make the brothers yell bbrrattt
The sisters say hey
Make the sisters say brraaatt
The brothers yell hey
Make the brothers yell bbrrattt
The sisters say hey
I hit the stage, and leave crater size of meteorites
The sound man getting pissed, he think im cupping the mic
But it's just me and my projection like a RPG
To shoot a unmanned drone into the god dam sea
You faint of heart, than this the part that you should stop the cd
Those rappers who claim they kill you are lying on TV
Megaphone the type of truth inside a low budget booth
Easy feed to feel what I do till i'm losing my tooth
I don't shoot like unprofessionals, duck'in eyes closed
They shakin about the liberals talking about gun control
Cause I know it's as simple as a power plant closing
Y'all don't know how to preserve your food if it ain't frozen
Y'all been screaming on that gun right, ready for revolt
But couldn't filter out the rain to clean some water to gulp
Grab a pen and try your hardest to image that the tip
'Bout the size that you alone even matter in all of this
I'm from a different time, and I uphold a different code
I hope we are connected, and I don't know
I know couple people listening is dealing with some real shit
(Real shit)
Feel like packing up your shit and skipping town for a bit
I'll throw you on my carry on and we take take a trip
Drinking drinks inside a hut and hearing real rap shit
Quick diving in the ocean to hear some real rap shit
Real rap shit
This that real rap shit
Central Cali what's up
Southern Cali what's up
North Cal' what's
Whole World what's up
Philippines what's up
Brrup....
Yeah
One more time

Saw Star Wars at least eight times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside
Stretch Armstrong (yeah)
I was Roger Staubach in my backyard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evil Knievel scars
On my right arm
I was a kid when Elvis died
And my momma cried
It was nineteen seventy somethin'
And the world that I grew up in
Farrah Fawcett hairdo days
Bell bottoms and eight track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
Oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh it was nineteen seventy-somethin'
It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
Dad broke down and
Finally shaved them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubik's Cube
Watched M-TV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke
And them cut-off jeans
Space Shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried
It was nineteen eighty-somethin'
And the world that I grew up in
Skatin' rinks and black Trans-Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
And lookin' back now I can see me
Oh man, did I look cheesy
I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh it was nineteen eighty-somethin'
Now I've got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish
Sometimes
That it was nineteen eighty-something
And the world that I grew up in
Skatin' rinks and black Trans-Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
And lookin' back now I can see me
Oh man, did I look cheesy
I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh it was nineteen eighty-something
Nineteen seventy-something
Oh, it was nineteen somethin'

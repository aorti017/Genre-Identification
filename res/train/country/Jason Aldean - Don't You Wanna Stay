I really hate to let this moment go
Touching your skin, and your hair falling slow
When a goodbye kiss, feels like this

[Chorus]
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

[Verse 2]
Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last
When you're up this high, it's a sad goodbye

[Chorus]

[Break]
Oh yeah

Oh, you feel so perfect, baby
Yeah, you feel so perfect, baby

[Chorus]
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

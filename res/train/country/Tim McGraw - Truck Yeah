Got Lil' Wayne pumpin on my ipod
Pumpin on the subs in the back of my crew cab
Redneck rockin' like a rockstar
Sling a lil mud off the back, we can do that
Friday night football, Saturday Last Call, Sunday Hallelujah
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud then you know what I'm
Talking about
Let me hear you say, Truck Yeah
Wanna get jacked up Yeah
Lets crank it on up Yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up Yeah
Till the sun comes up Yeah
If you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah
I party in the club in a honky tonk downtown
Yeah that's where I like to hang out
Chillin' in the back room
Hangin' with my whole crew
Sippin' on a cold brew, hey now!
Got a mixed up playlist, dj play this
Wanna hear a country song
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud throw your hands up now
Let me hear you shout,
Truck Yeah
Wanna get jacked up Yeah
Lets crank it on up Yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up Yeah
Til the sun comes up Yeah
If you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah
Rap or country, city farm
It don't matter who you are
Got a little fight, got a little love
Got a little redneck in your blood
Are you one of us?
Truck Yeah!
Wanna get jacked up Yeah
Lets crank it on up Yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up Yeah
Till the sun comes up Yeah
If you think this life I love is a little too country
You're right on the money
Truck yeah!

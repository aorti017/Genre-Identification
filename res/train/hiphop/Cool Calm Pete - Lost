Yo party people in the place to be
Yo this is Cool Calm Pete
I'mma do this in G minor
It goes lost in season
Running out of choices
Hard to cope with these lingering voices
Its hopeless I’ve got problems with authority
Its like the moral of the story is calling me
With silly pranks like you ain’t gonna win kid
This game is bugged these kids done jinxed it
Fix these plans I got hopes and dreams son
Rolling down hill and the year has just begun
I seen America lonely with its dick hard (Hello)
Wrote this on the back of a greeting card
From this bleeding heart rolling down a bitter start
It's these lessons you learn from that time apart
Pull my guns out shooting at the TV
So medicated, man, I damn missed the TV
But news is syndicated go catch the repeats
No place to hide run amok in the streets
It goes lost in the city
Running out of choices
Going nowhere fast
Still hearing voices
Come on legs come on feet
I’m just trying to make a little bit of history
It’s like you write with a sharpie
And you make a fine point
Not all city you hitting up the 5 Pointz
Jonsing for another attack next wave
You fake stunts that’s strictly for super Dave
Sun don’t shine now kiss the ass cheeks
These cats there testing lost there cheat sheets
If you’ve got questions then you must ask Pete
The antidote over these working class beats
Woke up in the P.M. the face is all crusty
My feet cold even the kicks are dusty
I’m snowed in I plowed through these negatives
Its such a pain when the bullshit's repetitive
So why bother even taking these next steps
Even yesterday is harder to recollect
Muster it up and step out of the house
Take a little trip and start tearing it out
Lost in the city
Running out of choices
Going nowhere fast
Still hearing voices
Come on legs come on feet
I’m just trying to make a little bit of history
I’m home sick rocking the New York logo
Its only been a week and you ain’t made no dough ohh
Well that blows and these are the breaks
A tall order of beef is high stakes
This is dedicated to the ones who think they getting old
Since childhood they’ve been calling you an old soul
Now bop that head its hip hop irony
For twenty sum odd years probably
Acting the same way ain’t nothing really change
Maybe that internet and new heads to blame
Glimpse of the future making these toes curl
And maybe then I'll stop spying on my ex girl
In this world famous to nameless
None of it is easy and none of it is painless
Weightless on the moon watching the Earth turn (turn)
Time on ya side and got money to burn (burn)
Got a new watch I got heat in the house
Got rhymes, got beats, no kid, no spouse
And I'mma turn it out
Yo it's my turn baby I'mma turn it out
Yo it's my turn baby I'mma turn it out
Yo it's my turn baby I'mma turn it out
Yo it's my turn baby I'mma turn it out

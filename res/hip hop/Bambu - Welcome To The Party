It go rrrang, oh man
Welcome to the party
Bolo and an AK
Holy when i prey on those prey on those who pray for better wages AK [rrrang-rrrang]
Came from the same bloodline as Andres (Bonifacio) General Apoy in a tactical vest
Ready for whatever type of shit we catch next
Never been afraid of no badge, bruh
Two police - that's a match up
I just came to make it all even
Because the field's uneven and we're living in the last, bruh a rebel of a devil in a dodger hat
They're killing our people we go hard for that
1-8-9-8 until we're finished with that
Don't let her pretty face fool you
She's going to hit you with that - rrrang-rrrang!
rrrang-rrrang oh man
Power to the people
Bambu where the fuck you find these crazy filipinos
I come from the same bloodline as gangbangers and crooks
The same bloodline as those who took up the frontline wit all the Huks (Hukbalahap)
And Katipunan una yun sa pag barrelan kalen man (the first to shoot, whenever)
I am bam
Down t' fight, pare, ilan (friend, how many?) - bring them on
What you thought this was a little okie doke
A little woopty woop
Cool story, bro
This ain't no muthuhfukking joking this is overthrow the recognition the ignition ain't in your control
And i already know i'm better than the bulk of these rats
So i don't spend a bunch of time trying to convince you of that my rap pap pap pap put a hole in your brain
Throw in a little bit of wisdom
Fill it back up again
It's like [rrrang], oh man
Welcome to the party
I can't call nobody when these banks is trying to rob me
Fuck it light a match
Fuck it throw a match
Fuck it let it burn
Fuck it, homie, [brrrrrrraaaat...]
I heard they're getting down down in mindanao
Rifles in the street in their hand me down's
Shower me in rubble when it crumble down
Yellin' ["shut th' fuck up bam they listenin' now!"]
In desperation they'll do anything to keep with the crown while we burning down the castle make a thunderous sound bang bang!
They do what we're doing to survive
Making money off of lives whether suffering or dying
They shoot children in our hood they police us on the block
And the system's for the cops, so they ain't tripping when we shot i got that los angeles slang talk
California thorough from th' old block
Oldies in your uncle rex's CRX while he was turnt off of shabs at your aunt's spot
Grimlock I'm dumb rock
Hip hop wita little bit of click pop
My clique got a bunch crooks in it, homie, fuck with it
Remember click pop?!
And let it burn - fire fire we don't need no water
Mi molotov - fire fire we don't need no water
Let it burn - fire fire we don't need no water

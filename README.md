Genre Identification
==========

Overview
---------
This is a personal project I have been working on to help facilitate learning how to use the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library as well as some machine learning algorithms and principles. 
The program uses various classification methods, along with some preprocessing, to determine if a song belongs to either the Hip Hop or Country genre based on the song's lyrics.
The training data goes through preprocessing, stemming and then the removal of stop words, before it is used to train the classifier. 
After the classifier is trained, the testing data goes through the same preprocessing and is then used to obtain predictions from the various classifiers.
The training and testing data can be found in ```./res/```.
